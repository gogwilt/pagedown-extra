Just plain **Markdown**, except that the input is sanitized:

# Markdown Extra

## Tables 

| Item             | Value |
| ---------------- | -----:|
| Air Conditioner  | $1600 |
| <del>Phone</del> |   $12 |
| *Pipe*           |    $1 |

I've added just some basic borders and padding. Notice that span-level tags will
still be rendered inside of the table. Also, you can specify a class for the generated
tables using `Markdown.Extra.init(converter, {table_class: "table table-striped"})` for instance.

## Fenced Code Blocks

```javascript
var foo = "bar";
```

You can also specify options. Markdown.Extra was given the following options
for this editor.

```javascript
  Markdown.Extra.init(converter1, {
    extensions: "all",
    highlighter: "prettify"
  });
```

This is the *second* editor.
------------------------------

It has a plugin hook registered that surrounds all words starting with the
letter A with asterisks before doing the Markdown conversion. Another one gives bare links
a nicer link text. User input isn't sanitized here:

Take a look at the source and you'll see that the tables
plugin is last in the chain. Otherwise, the `Air` in `Air Conditioner` would render
as raw markdown instead of being emphasized.

You can also specify additional options. Markdown.Extra was given the following options
for this editor.

```javascript
  Markdown.Extra.init(converter2, {
    extensions: "all",
    highlighter: "prettify"
  });

(asterisks around "all" are from the preConversion hook)
